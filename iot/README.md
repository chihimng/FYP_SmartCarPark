# IoT Data Upload
This repository contains the python module for uploading `IoTState` from IoT devices (for now). Used in SmartCarPark FYP Project

To get started, `git clone` and navigate to project folder, then:
```
./install.sh
```

This will create an virtualenv of python 3 in the project folder, which you should point your IDE's Python `PATH` to.

Put all necessary libraries in `requirements.txt`, then run `install.sh` again to install them.

Please put your service account credential json in the folder of the project, and rename it 'credentials.json'
